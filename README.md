# Perceptron

The following perceptron has been trained to recognize the difference between the letters “A” and “C”. For that purpose the training of the network first implemented the Heaviside algorithm and simple learning rule. Later the network implemented the Widrow Hoff algorithm and also with simple learning rule.
